You're walking through a snowy field, enjoying a beautiful winter day. Suddenly, a noise catches your attention, and you realize there's a network of tunnels in the snow, and some kind of creature seems to be wandering around inside!

You think it would be fun to find who's in there, but it might not be easy! Here's how to play:
- The network is made up of a bunch of holes, some of which are linked by underground tunnels. We represent the network as a graph, where each node is a hole, and each edge is a tunnel
- You can only look in the holes (the tunnels are too small for you); **you can check 1 hole per turn** - if the creature is there, you win!
- After each turn, the creature moves through a tunnel; in other words, after you've checked a hole, the creature will move to another hole directly connected to their current location. **They must move exactly 1 spot each turn**
- The creature is **very sneaky**, so you will need to find an **optimal** way to find them; if it's theoretically possible for them to evade you, they will!

Your task is to find the creature in as few moves as possible, and most importantly, to have fun!

Notes:
- There are 10 levels in total
- Exactly 1 of the levels is **impossible** ðŸ˜ˆ
- You may need to zoom out in order to view the whole game screen!
- If you're really having a hard time, you can activate "cheat mode" by pressing "c" on the keyboard (but that's cheating! you should at least give it your best honest effort first)
- Please don't look at the code, that would also be considered cheating! (and I'm not just saying that because it's embarassingly sloppy ðŸ˜…)
